```
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait, yes, I do,
like it just like that
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait, yes, I do,
like it just like that
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait
'til you're in my arms again
I can't wait, yes, I do,
like it just like that
