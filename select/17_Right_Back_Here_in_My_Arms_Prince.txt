Oh baby, right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms
Right back here, yeah

Don't want you to write me no letters
Don't want you calling my farm
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms
Alright

I ain't checkin' for the sweet talk, baby
(Right)
Talkin' 'bout how you're missin' my charms
(Right)
I just want you, I just want you

I just want you right back here in my arms
('Cuz that's my only mission)
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

Right back here in my arms, oh baby
Right back here in my arms, oh baby

I know you got a lot on your mind
(Right)
That's why I wanna give you some time
(Right)
Till I get to, till I get to
Till I get to hug that body so fine

I know you need a little space, just a little
That's why I ain't showin' my face
(Right)
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

Oh baby, right back here in my arms
(Right, right)
Right back in my arms
Right back, right back
Right back here in my arms
(Right)

No, no, no to the postman bringin' me letters
You know a brotha' gonna feel much better
If he keeps his mind on, you know, whatever
'Cuz I can't stop thinkin' about what we do

There ought to be a low against the hoochie, ooh
Can we groove? I don't wanna do you know harm
I just want you right back here in my arms
Oh baby, right back here in my arms

Don't want you to write me no letters
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms
Ooh yeah, right back here in my arms
I just want you right back here in my arms
(Right)
Right back here in my arms
(Right)
Right back, right back
(Right)
I'll try to write you back
Right back here in my arms
