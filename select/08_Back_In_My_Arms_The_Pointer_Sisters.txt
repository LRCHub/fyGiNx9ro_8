No one can see what you been doing
No one but me, I'm always watching you
I'm your conscience
I'm your conscience

No one can see what you been hiding
No one but me, knows what's inside of you
I'm your conscience
And I'm talking to you

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you're hearing
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

And no matter where you go
I'll, I'll be there
Just come back
I want you back in my arms
Oh, yeah, yeah

When you're hot I feel the fire
Until I'm caught up in your sweet desire
I'm your conscience
Listen to me

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you're hearing
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

And no matter where you go
I'll, I'll be there
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

What I feel
You may not understand
Oh, but you, oh you're still the only one
The only one for me

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you hear
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

And no matter where you go
I'll, I'll be there
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you're hearing
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

And no matter where you go
I'll, I'll be there
Just come back
I want you back in my arms

Boy, come back here
I'm the voice that you're hearing
Just come back
I want you back in my arms
