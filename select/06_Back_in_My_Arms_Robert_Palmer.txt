Back here baby
Back in my arms girl
You ain't got no reason to act like a stanger to me
Back here baby
Things are changing for the better
We've just got to keep our hearts open to seige
You've been taking care of business
Sure I've been meeting lost of folk
Sure I ain't been spending as much time with you as you'd like me to be
But if you sit at home and worry
Bout where and with who I might be
Then you're bound to have some trouble
Coz you worry bout your jealous mind
Don't let it move ya, don't let it move ya, don't let it move you away from me
Baby, back in my arms girl
You ain't got no reason to act like a stranger to me
Back here baby
Things are changing for the better
We've got to keep our hearts
Open at sea
But lovin' ain't possessing
So it's bound to keep us guessing
Not to trust in each other to be doing all that we can do
So when I'm far away baby
Remember I love you
Let your heart make all the choices
Don't listen to those jealous voices
Of changes, stages make it stronger,
Come on girl, we can see it through
Baby, back in my arms girl
You ain't got no reason to act like a stranger to me
Stranger to me
Back here in my arms
Back in my arms
You ain't got no reason to act like a stranger to me
Stranger to me
Just because we've been away from each other
You ain't got no reason to act like a stranger to me
Back in my arms girl
You ain't got no reason to act like a stranger to me
Stranger to me
Back here in my arms
